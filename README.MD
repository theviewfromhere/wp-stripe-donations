# WP Stripe Donations
**PLUGIN IS CURRENTLY 90% STABLE**\
A plugin for accepting stripe donations through wordpress. Currently under development with a laundry list of features to expand this to a larger fully functional plugin. Currently used with ACF to manage front end interface.

## Getting Started
If you're using WooCommerce the plugin will automatically use the stripe keys you enter there, otherwise head to `Settings -> Stripe Donations` to find plugin settings. Here you can enter keys along with the 5 options you'd like to use for donations, the 6th option that appears is `Outer`, allowing users to pick their donation.

To add the output to your site simply use the shortcode `[donation_block]`, and you're good to go!

## Pipeline
- Add further customization
	- Change text on `other`
	- Add/Remove options
	- Possibly colour/themeing options (at least light/dark)
	- Set initial value to `test mode`
